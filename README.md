# COMP5212 Machine Learning Project

ðŸŽ‰ Welcome to our COMP5212 machine learning project repository! ðŸŽ‰

## Project Overview
This project focuses on geolocation prediction (country) using Google Street View pictures. We employ the MobileNet architecture due to its high efficiency and low compute cost, making it suitable for real-world applications. The project consists of several key aspects, including the configuration folder, model implementation, training loop, and testing loop.

## Folder Structure
- `config/`: Contains the YAML configuration file.
- `models/`: Contains model implementation files.
- `train.py`: Training loop script.
- `test.py`: Testing loop script.
- `main.py`: Main script for training or testing, with configurable hyperparameters.

## Usage
1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/comp5212-project.git
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```
   cd comp5212-project
    ```
3. Install the required dependencies:

   ```
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
4. Customize the configuration in the config/config.yaml file as needed.
Run the main script with desired options:

   ```
    python main.py --mode train --config config/config.yaml
    ```

Replace `--mode train` with `--mode test` for testing.
Adjust other hyperparameters in the config file, if desired.
